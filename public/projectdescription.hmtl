<pre> 
In my Final Project I am planning on at least four levels. Level one will be the game Template assignment.
In Level two there will be a car which have to go to a labyrinth to win. Every time the car drives against a wall the position of the car will be reset.
Probably there will be a button to start the game and a timer. The timer because you have to do the labyrinth in less than 30 seconds. 
In Level three there gonna be cheese and mouse traps falling down the top of the screen. On the button of the screen gonna be a mouse which has catch the cheese and shoot the mouse traps. 
If the mouse hits a mousetrap the game is over. to win 2000 points must be scored. For every cheese the mouse catches 100 points will be added. 
In Level four its gonna be a endless game where your only goal is to beat your highscore. First the player get to choose a character with wich he going to shoot monsters.
The monsters following the player automatically. After every 3 seconds its going to be two monsters more who follow him over the map. I am planning on adding trophies who will be safed.
